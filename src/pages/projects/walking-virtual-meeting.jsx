        <p>
            Over the summer of 2023, I had the pleasure of going to the National Taiwan University
            Human-Computer Interaction Lab (<a href="https://ntuhci.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">NTU HCI Lab</a>)
            as part of the NTU Plus Academy Summer+ Research and Culture exchange program!
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the papers of which I co-authored is "Exploring Augmented Reality Interface Designs for Virtual Meetings
            in Real-world Walking Contexts", awared Honorable Mention at the 2024 Designing Interactive Systems Conference
            in Copenhagen, Denmark. The paper explores augmented reality (AR) interface design for virtual meetings in
            real-world walking conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
            My main contributions to the paper include:
            <ol>
            <br/>
                <li>Simulating webpage interaction in AR via <span className={styles["project-skill"]}>JavaScript</span> and <span className={styles["project-skill"]}>Unity C#</span></li><br/>
                <li>Assiting with the facilitation of user studies</li><br/>
                <li>Finding and consolidating related works as part of paper-writing</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
